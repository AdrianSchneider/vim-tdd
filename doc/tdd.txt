INTRODUCTION                                             *tdd*

This plugin provides a framework for creating and launching tests for
a tight feedback loop. It uses tmux to send test commands to other
panes.


LANGUAGE SETUP                                       *tdd-setup*

To get started, you'll need to configure your language with a test
runner and a file mapper.

g:tdd_test_command should point to a test runner
g:tdd_map_callback should name a function similar to the below:

function! YourCallback(file)
    return "/path/to/test/for/a:file"
endfunction



CONFIGURATION                                       *tdd-config*

g:tdd_clear - 1|0, enable clearing screen before test
    defaults to 1

g:tdd_prerun - 1|0, enable pre-run commands
    defaults to 0

g:tdd_prerun_command - arbitrary command to run before testing
    useful for restarting servers or other cleanup

g:tdd_fail_commad - run when test exits with non-zero
    defaults to 'beep'

g:tdd_tmux_target - set alternative tmux target to fire tests in
    defaults to '', currentwindow.1 is used by default
